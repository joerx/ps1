Git Prompt
==========

Just to store the stuff I hacked together to customize my bash prompt. Almost
none of this is my work, most credits go to Shawn O. Pearce [spearce@spearce.org] 
for the .git-prompt script.

Tested and found to work on Ubuntu, Fedora & OSX

Installation
------------

 - Place .ps1 and .git-prompt inside your home
 - append `source ~/.ps1` to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
 - Customize the content of ~/.ps1 to your liking
